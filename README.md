## Scenario: 
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission seeks a way to utilize the data collected from the New York City area to predict the fare amount for taxi cab rides.

The following project is composed of four parts of the PACE Model consisting of Plan, Analyze, Construct and Execute.

# PLAN 
## Project Goals
The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has accumulated a vast amount of data from taxi cab rides across the city. This valuable dataset contains information on factors such as trip duration, pickup and drop-off locations, passenger count, and payment type, among others. The TLC now aims to leverage this rich dataset to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the fare amount for taxi cab rides within the city.
